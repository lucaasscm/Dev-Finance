Finance app made with the first Discover marathon from RocketSeat.


# Finance Website

Hi! I'm Lucas. I developed this site based on a Marathone promoted by RocketSeat! It was a great opportunity to learn about HTML, CSS, Javascript, and how to deal with the DOM using Js. 


# Files

- We have our assets file with all the images used in the project.
- Our index.html is the structure of our webpage.
- And the CSS file is our style file.
- Also, the script.js is our JavaScript file, where we configured all the dynamic changes
